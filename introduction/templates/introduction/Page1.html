    <h5>Dear Participant,</h5>
    We are a group of researchers from the Nazarbayev University studying investment decision-making and its behavioral
    aspects. The research intends to study how individuals construct their investment portfolios in a dynamic setup.

    experiment, you should complete all tasks presented in this web interface. <b>Your participation is voluntary, and you
    can withdraw at any time.</b> This experiment is confidential and takes approximately 40-80 minutes to complete.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Risks:</b> No significant risks for experiment participants have been identified during the elaboration of the
    tasks.<br>
