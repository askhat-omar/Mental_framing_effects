    <h5>Dear Participant,</h5>
    We are researchers from the University of St. Gallen and Nazarbayev University. We study investment decision-making
    and its behavioral aspects. Our research aims to understand how individuals construct their investment portfolios in
    a dynamic setup. Before you start the survey, please read the information below carefully.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Procedures:</b> We are conducting an online experiment. To participate, you need to complete all tasks presented
    in this web interface. <b>Your participation is voluntary and confidential, and you can withdraw at any time.</b>
    The majority of participants typically complete the experiment in 30-45 minutes. However, to ensure you do not feel
    rushed, the experiment will remain open for up to 90 minutes from the start.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Risks:</b> There are no significant risks identified for participants in this experiment.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Benefits:</b> Our research aims to enhance the general knowledge of behavioral finance. The findings will help
    policymakers design decision support tools and assist investment advisors in creating products that meet various
    investors' needs.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Compensation:</b> Every participant will receive <b>8 Swiss Francs.</b> Additionally, all participants will get
    cash prizes that depend on points earned and random realizations during the experiment. The prize amounts typically
    range from 5 to 90 Swiss Francs. Please provide your matriculation number to enter the lottery. We can also provide
    you with a copy of the research results after the study is completed.<br>
