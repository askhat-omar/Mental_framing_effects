    <h5>Data Usage</h5>
    We are kindly requesting you to participate in a financial choice experiment. During the experiment we use your
    personal data (name, student ID and e-mail) in order to be able to process your participation (recall that your
    completion of the four parts of the experiment is a requirement for you to earn the two bonus points) and a potential
    financial payoff (see below). However, we will anonymize your identity after the above processing is completed and
    not share it with any other party. We also keep the data on a password protected computer and destroy the data
    within three years from now. You may earn real money in the experiment (as a gift card in Akademibokhandeln) but, of
    course, you are not exposed to any risk of losing money from your own pocket. You will also get to practice some of
    the concepts we have learned in Basic Financial Statistics and Portfolio Theory.<br>
    <br>
    Before proceeding to the experiment please complete the data privacy consent form below.<br>
