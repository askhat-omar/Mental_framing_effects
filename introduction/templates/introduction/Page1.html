    <h5>Dear Participant,</h5>
    We are researchers from the University of St. Gallen and Nazarbayev University in Astana. We study investment
    decision-making and its behavioral aspects. Our research aims to understand how individuals deal with risk and
    complexity. Before you start the experiment, please read the information below carefully. This is necessary to
    ensure proper participation and incentive payment.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Procedures:</b> We are conducting an online experiment. To participate, you need to complete all tasks presented
    in this web interface. <b>Your participation is voluntary and confidential, and you can withdraw at any time.</b>
    Based on our experience, the majority of participants typically complete the experiment in 30-45 minutes. However,
    to ensure you do not feel rushed, the experiment will remain open for up to 90 minutes from the start.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Risks:</b> There are no significant risks identified for participants in this experiment.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Benefits:</b> Our research aims to enhance the general knowledge of behavioral finance. The findings will help
    practitioners, policy-makers and researchers design financial products, market legislation and decision support
    tools.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Compensation:</b> Every participant will receive <b>10 Swiss Francs.</b> Additionally, we will <b>randomly select
    three participants</b> to win cash prizes based on their choices and resulting performance (points earned) during the
    experiment. Each participant has an equal probability of being selected for the extra cash prize, regardless of
    performance, but the prize amount is tied to performance. The cash prizes range <b>from a minimum of 200 to a maximum
    of 1,500 Swiss Francs</b>, with 95% confidence, and the median prize is 1,000 Swiss Francs. Please provide your
    matriculation number to enter the lottery. Upon request, we can also provide you with a copy of the research results
    after the study is completed.
